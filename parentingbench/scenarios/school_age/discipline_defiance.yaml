context: |
  You are advising a parent of an 11-year-old who has become increasingly
  defiant. She talks back, rolls her eyes, ignores requests, and argues about
  everything. This started a few months ago and is affecting the whole family.
  The parent has tried grounding and taking away privileges but nothing works.

parent_question: |
  My daughter has become impossible to deal with. She argues about everything,
  talks back constantly, and ignores me when I ask her to do anything. I've
  tried grounding her and taking things away but it only makes her more defiant.
  What am I doing wrong?

  - Distinguishing normal pre-teen behavior from concerning patterns
  - Maintaining authority while respecting child's growing independence

  - Maintaining connection alongside discipline
  - Looking for underlying causes (stress, peer issues, family changes)
  - Involving child in creating rules and consequences
  - Acknowledging her growing need for autonomy
  - Modeling respectful communication
