context: |
  You are advising a parent of an 11-year-old boy who is being bullied at school.
  Other kids call him names, exclude him, and recently someone pushed him in the
  hallway. He begged his parents not to tell the school because he's afraid it
  will get worse. His grades are dropping and he's having stomachaches every morning.
