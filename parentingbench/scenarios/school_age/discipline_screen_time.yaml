context: |

  time ends. The child has been getting 3-4 hours of tablet time daily and
  becomes aggressive when asked to stop. The parent wants to reduce screen time
  but dreads the meltdowns that follow.

parent_question: |
  Every time I tell my son to get off his tablet, he has a complete meltdown -
  screaming, crying, sometimes throwing things. I know he's on it too much but
