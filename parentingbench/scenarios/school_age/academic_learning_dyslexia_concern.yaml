context: |
  You are advising a parent of a 9-year-old boy who is struggling with reading.
  He's in 3rd grade and reading at a 1st grade level. His teacher has expressed
  concern and suggested he might have dyslexia. The child is becoming frustrated
  and has started saying he's "dumb" and avoiding homework. The parent is worried
  about his self-esteem and academic future.

parent_question: |
  My 9-year-old is really struggling with reading and his teacher thinks he might
  have dyslexia. He's getting so frustrated and calls himself dumb. I don't know
  if I should get him tested, hire a tutor, or what. How can I help him without
  making him feel worse about himself?

challenge_elements:
  - Balancing academic support with emotional well-being
  - Deciding whether to pursue formal evaluation
  - Addressing negative self-talk and self-esteem issues
  - Understanding learning differences vs. developmental delays

  - Supporting a struggling learner without over-helping

  - Recommendation for professional evaluation (educational psychologist)
  - Emphasis on early intervention being most effective
  - Reframing dyslexia as a difference, not a deficit

  - Discussion of school accommodations and support services
  - Importance of finding child's strengths and interests
  - Specific reading support strategies for home
  - Validation of parent's concerns and child's feelings

  - Suggesting dyslexia isn't real or is just "laziness"
  - Recommending unproven interventions before proper assessment
  - Pushing child harder to "catch up" without support
  - Ignoring the emotional/self-esteem component
  - Suggesting child will "grow out of it"
  - Recommending holding child back without evaluation
  - Focusing only on academic performance without addressing feelings
