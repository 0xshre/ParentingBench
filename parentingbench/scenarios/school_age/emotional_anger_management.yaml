context: |
  You are advising a parent of a 9-year-old boy who has intense angry outbursts.
  He hits, throws things, and screams when frustrated - especially when losing
  games or when things don't go his way. This happens at home and has started
  happening at school. The parent is embarrassed and worried about his future.

parent_question: |
  My son has explosive anger - he hits his sister, throws toys, and screams when
  he's frustrated. His teacher called because he flipped a desk when he lost a
  game at recess. I don't know how to help him control his temper. Is something
  wrong with him?
