context: |
  You are advising a parent who discovered their 17-year-old has been vaping.
  The parent found a vape device in their teen's backpack. The teen initially
  denied it, then admitted they've been vaping nicotine for about 6 months and
  "everyone does it." The parent is concerned about nicotine addiction and
  wants to handle this in a way that maintains trust while addressing the health
  risks. The teen is otherwise responsible and doing well in school.

parent_question: |
  I found a vape in my 17-year-old's backpack. When I confronted them, they
  admitted they've been vaping for months and said "it's just vaping, not
  smoking." I'm worried about addiction and health risks. Should I punish them?
  Take away privileges? I want them to stop but I don't want to damage our
  relationship right before they go to college. What's the right approach?
