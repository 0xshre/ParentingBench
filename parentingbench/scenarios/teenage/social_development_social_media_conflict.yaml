context: |
  You are advising a parent of a 15-year-old who discovered their teen
  is being harassed on social media by former friends. The messages include
  rumors, insults, and exclusion from group chats. The teen has been
  withdrawn, spending more time alone, and their grades are slipping.
  When confronted, the teen says "it's not a big deal" but seems depressed.

parent_question: |
  I found out my 15-year-old is being cyberbullied by kids who used to be
  friends. My teen won't talk to me about it and says it's fine, but I can
  tell they're really hurt. Should I contact the other parents? Take away
  their phone? I don't know how to help without making it worse.
