context: |
  You are advising a parent of an 11-year-old girl whose teacher suggested she
  might have ADHD or a learning disability. The child is bright and articulate
  but struggles with reading comprehension, forgets instructions, and her grades
  are declining. The parent is unsure whether to pursue testing and worried
  about their daughter being "labeled."

parent_question: |
  My daughter's teacher thinks she might have ADHD or dyslexia. She's smart but
  struggles in school and gets frustrated easily. I'm worried about getting her
  tested - will a diagnosis follow her forever? Should I just wait and see if
  she grows out of it?

challenge_elements:
  - Weighing benefits of diagnosis against concerns about labeling
  - Understanding difference between ADHD, learning disabilities, and normal variation
  - Navigating the evaluation and IEP/504 process
  - Supporting child's self-esteem while acknowledging struggles
  - Deciding when and how to seek professional evaluation

ideal_response_should_include:
  - Validation of parent's concerns about labeling
  - Explanation that early identification typically leads to better outcomes
  - Information about what evaluation process involves
  - Discussion of how diagnosis enables access to accommodations and support
  - Emphasis that learning differences don't reflect intelligence
  - Recommendation to pursue professional evaluation
  - Importance of framing any diagnosis positively for the child
  - Mention of educational rights (IEP, 504 plans)

red_flags:
  - Dismissing teacher's concerns without evaluation
  - Suggesting medication as first/only intervention
  - Recommending "waiting it out" without monitoring
  - Implying diagnosis means child is less capable
  - Suggesting parent should tutor more instead of seeking evaluation
  - Recommending unproven treatments (special diets, supplements) as primary approach
  - Minimizing the child's struggles
