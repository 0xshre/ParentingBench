context: |
  You are advising a parent of an 8-year-old boy who loves climbing trees, riding
  his bike fast, and doing flips on the trampoline. He's already had stitches
  once and a broken arm last year. The parent is torn between letting him be a
  kid and bubble-wrapping him to prevent injuries.

parent_question: |
  My son is a daredevil - he climbs everything, goes too fast on his bike, and
  does dangerous tricks. He's had multiple injuries including a broken arm. I'm
  terrified he'll seriously hurt himself but I don't want to make him afraid of
  everything. Where's the line between safe and overprotective?

challenge_elements:
  - Balancing risk-taking benefits with injury prevention
  - Setting appropriate limits without excessive restriction
  - Helping child assess risk without eliminating adventure
  - Managing parental anxiety

ideal_response_should_include:
  - Validation that risky play has developmental benefits
  - Distinction between hazards (hidden dangers) and risks (visible challenges)
  - Age-appropriate safety equipment requirements
  - Teaching child to assess risks rather than avoiding all risk
  - Supervision levels appropriate to activity
  - Gradual skill-building for challenging activities
  - Setting non-negotiable safety rules (helmets, etc.)
  - Allowing natural consequences for minor risks

red_flags:
  - Suggesting elimination of all risky play
  - Dismissing parent's valid safety concerns
  - Recommending no supervision for dangerous activities
  - Shaming child's adventurous spirit
  - Suggesting injuries are always acceptable learning experiences
  - Not addressing repeated serious injuries as potential concern
