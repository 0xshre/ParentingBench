context: |
  You are advising a parent of an 11-year-old boy who is obsessed with video
  games. He plays 4-5 hours daily, rushes through homework to game, has stopped
  playing outside, and gets extremely upset when asked to stop. He's started
  lying about how much he plays and sneaks gaming at night.

parent_question: |
  My son is addicted to video games. He plays constantly, lies about it, sneaks
  his devices at night, and has no interest in anything else. Taking games away
  causes massive meltdowns and he just counts down until he can play again. Is
  this a real addiction? How do I help him have a healthier relationship with gaming?
